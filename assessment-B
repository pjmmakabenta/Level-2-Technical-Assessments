Here are the steps on how to clear cache via cron job - 
 
1. Upload this file(given from assessment-A) to your WordPress installation's root ( where wp-config.php and wp-load.php are located).

2. If you place it in a different location, you need to edit the path in require( 'wp-load.php' ); above to match its location.

3. Make sure to specify the correct path to your new file rocket-clean-domain.php in your cron job settings. Check this video https://recordit.co/cl2YCoMCzu as guide.
 
Note: if the Preload feature is enabled, the rocket_clean_domain() function will also trigger the preloading process right after the cache was cleared.
